# Telegram-DMI-Bot

**Telegram-DMI-Bot** is the platform that powers **@DMI_bot**, a Telegram bot aided at helping students find informations about professors, classes' schedules, administration's office hours and more.

###Setting up a local istance
If you want to test the bot by creating your personal istance, follow this steps:
* **Clone this repository** or download it as zip.
* **Edit "telegrambot.py" to include your token.** (If you don't have a token, message Telegram's @BotFather to create a bot and get a token for it)
* **Send a message to your bot** on Telegram, even '/start' will do. If you don't, you could get an error.
* If your system supports bash shell scripting, **launch "restarter.sh"**. Alternatively, you can launch "telegrambot.py" with your Python interpreter, even if doing so will not restart the bot in the event of a crash.

Fot the bot istance to be executed, your system must have a Python 2 interpreter.

###Using the live version
The bot is live on Telegram with the username [@DMI_bot](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@DMI_Bot).
Send **'/start'** to start it, **'/help'** to see a list of commands.

Please note that the commands and their answers from the bot are in Italian.
